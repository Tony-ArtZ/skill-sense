SkillSense — Unlock Your Hidden Potential
Track: Corporate Track (SAP Challenge)

1. Motivation / Goal to Achieve

The future of work is rapidly shifting from credentials-based hiring to skills-based talent
management. Yet, individuals often possess a wealth of capabilities that remain undocumented
underutilized, or are maybe even unknown. SkillSense aims to revolutionize how we discover
and validate these hidden skills by leveraging Al to build dynamic, multi-source skill profiles

Traditional resumes capture only a fraction of what people truly know. Skills acquired through
projects, mentorship, and informal learning often go unnoticed. This leads to missed
opportunities for individuals and friction in talent matching for employers. SkillSense addresses
this by creating intelligent systems that uncover hidden expertise and provide actionable
insights for career development and organizational operations.

Or in simple words, SkillSense tries to answer: What am | good at?
2. Core Features (MVP)

Participants are expected to build at least one Al-powered application that identifies skills
for a specific person by:

e Aggregating data from multiple sources (e.g., CVs, LinkedIn, GitHub, blogs, or
publications) but also internal company documents such as goals, performance reviews,
and reference letters

e Extracting both explicit and implicit skills using NLP and semantic analysis

e Generating structured, dynamic skill profiles per person with confidence scores and
evidence trails

e Summarizing and editing of identified skills per person to remove hallucinations

Based on these skill profiles a bunch of new use cases are possible:

complementary teams

Overview of a set of people to identify individual experts but also gaps in an entire
organization

3. Constraints & considerations

Privacy considerations must be addressed: define what data is shared vs. private

The challenge can start simple with one or two structured sources but gets complicated
the more sources will be considered — so choose them wisely

In best case, you will also include a formal skill framework that will allow some
comparison and assessment of capabilities

Use synthetic or publicly available data if real user data is not accessible but in best
case you can use your own data and find hidden gems in your own skills

4. Hints and Resources

Data Sources

Start with your own latest CV and extend this with your public profiles such as Linkedin,
GitHub, Personal blogs and websites, Instagram etc.

There are also plenty of data sets such as Kaggle resume datasets, Academic CV
corpora, or start with simulating employee user profiles incl. their goals and performance
reviews

5. Why It Matters

SkillSense will empower:

Individuals to discover hidden strengths and strategically build their personal brand
Teams to staff projects with the perfect skill mix in minutes

Learning & Development to create personalized upskilling paths

Organizations to identify internal experts and unlock hidden talent

We're entering an era where skills are the new currency. Traditional hiring methods are no
longer sufficient. SkillSense provides the infrastructure to support skills-based career navigation,
helping students, professionals, and companies thrive in a dynamic job market. This challenge
invites participants to build tools that unlock human potential—one skill at a time.

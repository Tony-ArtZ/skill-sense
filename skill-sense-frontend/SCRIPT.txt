Presenter: "We're launching 'Project Chimera,' a critical initiative. The requirements are demanding, needing not just specific technical skills but also abstract qualities that are hard
  to find on a resume. Let's see if our agent can build the perfect team."

  Action 1: Ingest All Unstructured Data

   1 You: ingest_url project_chimera_brief.txt
   2 You: upload alice_resume.docx
   3 You: upload bob_performance_review.pdf
   4 You: upload carlos_peer_reviews.json
  Presenter: "The agent has now consumed the project brief, a resume, a performance review, and even 360-degree peer feedback. It has a complete picture of our data landscape."

  Action 2: The Strategic "Who" Question

   1 You: Based on all available data, who is the best candidate to LEAD Project Chimera?
  Showcase Moment: This is the first "wow." The agent will perform a massive hybrid query.
   * It will use RAG on the brief to identify the need for "low-latency API design" and "grace under pressure."
   * It will use RAG on Alice's resume and infer that her "Trading API" project matches these abstract requirements.
   * It will use RAG on Bob's review and see his technical strength but also the subtle red flag about his documentation.
   * It will use RAG on Carlos's peer reviews to see his mentorship skills.
   * It will then synthesize all of this into a nuanced recommendation: "Alice is the strongest candidate for the lead role, as her resume demonstrates experience with high-stakes,
     low-latency projects. Carlos shows strong mentorship qualities, making him a potential tech lead."

  Action 3: The "Skill Gap" Analysis
  Presenter: "Alice is a great fit for the lead. Now, what skills is she missing for this project?"

   1 You: What are the skill gaps between Alice's resume and the Project Chimera brief?
  Showcase Moment: The agent will perform a comparative RAG query. It will look at the skills mentioned in the brief and cross-reference them with the skills found in her resume, identifying
  any missing pieces. This shows the agent can not only find information but also perform a gap analysis between two documents.

  Action 4: The "Team Cohesion" Query
  Presenter: "Building a team isn't just about skills; it's about how people work together. Let's build the rest of the team around Alice."

   1 You: Find two other engineers who have successfully worked with Alice in the past and possess skills in 'algorithmic optimization' or 'React'.
  Showcase Moment: This query forces the agent to use the SQL tool to query the new project_members table to find past collaborators, and then join that with the skills table to match the
  technical requirements. This demonstrates its ability to reason about relationships and team dynamics.

  ---

  Action 5: The Final Recommendation
  Presenter: "We have our candidates. Now for the final recommendation."

   1 You: Generate a final team proposal for Project Chimera with Alice as the lead, and provide a justification for each member's inclusion based on all available data.
  Showcase Moment: This is the grand finale. The agent will synthesize everything it has learned from the previous queries—the project needs, the candidates' strengths and weaknesses from
  their documents, and their past collaborations from the database—to generate a comprehensive, well-reasoned proposal for the entire team.

  This script tells a much more profound story: the AI is not just a data retriever; it's a strategic talent advisor.
